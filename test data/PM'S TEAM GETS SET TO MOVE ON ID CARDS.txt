PM'S TEAM GETS SET TO MOVE ON ID CARDS

by Clive Mathew-Wilson

The Government plans to introduce a National Identity Number scheme for
all New Zealanders by the end of next year, Computerworld sources say.

The numbering system is likely to involve the use of a "smart" ID card.

A team working on the project with the Prime Minister's office has yet
to announce its findings to Parliament, but it is understood it is the
format of the ID scheme, not the scheme itself, that is being debated.

Usually reliable sources within Parliament suggest the ID scheme -
originally proposed by the International Monetary Fund - was already
part of Treasury's economic reform plans before the election, and that
it is being implemented virtually without change by the new Government.

The first stage of implementation - data sharing between the Social
Welfare department and the IRD - is expected to take place shortly.

It is understood that in place of any new common identity numbering
scheme, the issuing and control of IRD numbers will be tightened, and an
IRD number used in all relevant transactions throughout various
government departments.

More than 1.7 million ID numbers are currently allocated to wage and
salary earners, and recent changes to tax laws require every bank
account to be tagged with an IRD number by 1992.

This would, in effect, give every New Zealander a unique, computerised
serial number.

It is believed the only real problems facing the ID card scheme are
those of computer power.

Doubts have been raised over the ability of existing systems to cope
with the information-handling and storage needs of a National ID Card.

The most likely scenario at present, entails a gradual phasing-in of
both the card and the information-matching based around it, starting
with data-matching between the huge Social Welfare and IRD computer
systems, which operate out of the same GCS installation at Trentham.

One key target of the ID card is understood to be the public health
system. The computerised "smart" card, with its instant reference to a
person's income details, is to be used to target healthcare as the
public health system is wound down.

If Computerworld's source is correct, a number of politicians and civil
servants appear to have been economical with the truth.

Prime Minister Jim Bolger, while he was in opposition, undertook not to
introduce a common identification number system, despite a confirmation
by the IRD at the time that the IRD number was, in fact, such a system
already.

Similarly, shortly before the elections last year Inland Revenue
Commissioner Dave Henry denied the IRD had plans to link its computer
systems with those of Customs, Births, Deaths and Marriages, Social
Welfare, Housing Corporation and ACC. Shortly after the election, plans
to link the Social Welfare and IRD computers were announced.

The Australian Government, which failed dismally in its plans to launch
a national ID card, is understood to be watching the New Zealand
experiment with interest, pending a possible re-introduction of the
scheme in Australia in a somewhat different form.

Civil liberties spokesperson Barry Wilson attacks what he terms a
"conspiracy of silence" over the issue.

"When has there been any informed public debate over whether New
Zealanders need or want ID cards? The public, by and large, has been
completely ignored," he says.

"New Zealanders voted against the ID card scheme when they dumped
Labour."

Computerworld sought ministerial and IRD response on the issues, but
neither had answered our calls by press time.

KIWICARD AND YOU...

In a pre-election speech Ruth Richardson said, "ID cards have got 
all the trappings of Big Brother - I am a freedom loving New 
Zealander."  Jim Bolger said "National absolutely rejected any 
proposal for a common numbering system between the two departments 
[Inland Revenue and Social Welfare] or for identity cards."

BROKEN PROMISES!

Soon the data matching between these departments is to commence, and 
the first Kiwicards, or Community Services Cards, as we are supposed 
to call them, are to be sent to beneficiaries.

THE GOVERNMENT TELLS US THE CARDS ARE VOLUNTARY, yet they are 
automatically to be sent out to beneficiaries and pensioners.  They 
are needed to obtain free or subsidised health care and many 
families are so hard pressed by job losses and benefit cuts that the 
card will be a necessity.  Each card has the CARDHOLDER'S NAME AND 
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.  So much for that promise.

THE CARDS HAVE A MAGNETIC STRIPE which Mrs Shipley states is never 
to be read by a machine.  If that is the case, why is it on the card?

THEY ESTABLISH ENTITLEMENT TO SUBSIDISED HEALTH CARE BUT ARE NOT 
SUFFICIENTLY SOPHISTICATED TO DO THIS ON THEIR OWN.  The Minister of 
Health has said that "up to five cards may be involved."  The 
obvious next step is to make the card "smart".  How long do you 
think it will take for the Government to break its promise not to 
make it a "smart" card?  Maybe they will keep that promise and give 
the "smart" card another name.  "Dumb" or "smart", and whatever it 
is called, the Kiwicard still stinks.


QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK

- Why are new cards being devised for health care when we already 
  have adequate existing systems?

- Why was the legislation for the Kiwicard rushed through without 
  consultation with the public or a Parliamentary Select Committee 
  hearing?

- Why are enormous amounts of money being spent on computer system 
  when these funds could be targeted to health care users?

- If the Kiwicard is not to be extended to other fields, why is the 
  legislation authorising it worded to allow much more extensive use?

- Why are there no safeguards against the misuse of the card by 
  Government agencies, such as the police, or by private enterprise?

- There has been no formal cost-benefit analysis to assess a need 
  for data matching.  It is likely to cost well in excess of half a 
  billion dollars and will bring unproven and unknown financial 
  return.  How can this sort of expense be justified?

- Although the card has been presented as a health entitlement card 
  for low income earners, it has been stated to be inadequate for 
  the task.  A member of the Government "Change Team" told TV3 that 
  a "smart" national ID card is being planned for all New 
  Zealanders.  The New Zealand Privacy Foundation believes that the 
  Kiwicard is the thin end of the wedge, paving the way for the 
  "smart" card.


AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW ZEALND PRIVACY FOUNDATION

- To act as a watchdog on privacy issues.

- To put a stop to the Kiwicard (now known as Community Services 
  Card) and related erosions of personal privacy, including 
  information swapping between Government departments and proposals 
  to introduce "unique personal identifiers."

- To oppose the development of surveillance systems that intrude 
  upon the rights and privacy of the indiviual, especially systems 
  of data matching, identification cards and unique numbering 
  systems.

- To campaign and lobby for the protection of the individual against 
  privacy intrusion.

- To educate New Zealanders and increase public awareness in 
  relation to the right of personal privacy and privacy issues.

- To conduct research into privacy related issues and technologies.
